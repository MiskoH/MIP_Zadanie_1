\begin{abstract}
Narrowing down the context in the ranking phase of information 
retrieval has been shown to produce results that are
more relevant to searcher's need. We have identified two
types of contexts that could be used in the process of personalisation. 
We research these contexts in the domain of
personalised search, but show that our approach can be used
for any kind of personalisation or recommendation. We focus on 
two aspects of the context: temporal context and
activity-based context and describe a more general personalisation 
framework based on lightweight semantics, that can
leverage any type of context.

\section{Introduction}

Recommendation systems and search engines play a crucial 
role in accessing the amount of content that can be
found of the Web nowadays. Users are usually able to filter 
the information by issuing short keyword queries, but
this model has several known disadvantages. The number
of keywords is usually low, typically 1-3 keywords [8] and
many of the words are ambiguous. The queries are almost
never accurate [5], they are either too generic or too specific,
but almost never exactly aligned with the specific intent the
user has in mind. When we combine the impact of each of
the described problem, we come to a conclusion, that finding
the relevant document is indeed a dificult task, both for the
user and the search engine.

A number of approaches have been researched, each with the speci c goal of helping people nd relevant content, preferably without changing the established paradigm of searching by keywords. The approaches range from modify-ing the query in-place to better capture the speci c intent

the user has in mind, i.e., query reformulation [3], learning to rank [9], or relevance feedback [12].

Each of the existing approaches leverages some sort of con-text to infer user's search intent and personalize the search results accordingly. Most of the time, the search context is long-term, built from all available data, e.g. learning to rank approaches use clickthrough data to learn user's pref-erence based on her past search result clicks. The other extreme, short-term context is used in relevance feedback, where search results are modi ed according to user's last ac-tion, with a basic assumption, that a click represents a form of implicit feedback on the relevance of the clicked search result.

In all cases, the time by which the context is bound is
determined statically and does not adapt to what is 
appropriate in the given situation. Long-term search context
has the advantage that much data about the user is available, 
so the personalisation system can make reliable model
of user's long-term interests. However, when a new, previously 
unseen goal appears, the information in the long-term
model can shadow it, leading to bad personalization. E.g.,
an aquarium guide looking to buy a new Barracuda hard
drive - the term Barracuda is associated with a sea fish in
the model of his interests and the search results are 
personalized towards results that deal with sea and fish, while the
guide is in fact looking for information on the specific model
of the hard drive. On the other hand, the short-context can
contain so little information, that no personalisation is possible, 
because no search goal can be inferred. We believe
that the solution to this problem is to select the size of context 
dynamically at the time of search, and that the search
context should be as specific as possible.

We have identified two types of search context that may
be helpful in personalizing the search:

\begin{itemize} 
\item \textit{Activity-based context}, which is based on user's actions;
what is she doing, how is she interacting with the
search engine in terms of clicking on the search results.
The activity-based search context is basically bounded
by the changes in information-seeking goals. This context starts, and 
ends with each change in informationseeking goal.
\item \textit{Recurrent temporal context}, which is based on user's
preferences in time. We assume that users form some
kinds of recurrent habits that correlate with time, e.g.,
someone may be searching for work-related goals most
of the time during work-week, while on weekends, the
search goals are very difierent. The temporal habits
may happen on a larger scale, e.g. searching for 
asparagus recipes in spring, during the asparagus season.
\end{itemize}



\section{CONTEXT MODELING AND PERSON- ALISATION FRAMEWORK}
We model user's context using lightweight metadata extracted from 
accessed documents. Normally, a personalisation system would have
 access to this type of information
in a direct way, but for the purposes of our research, we are
collecting this information using a logging proxy server \cite{barla}.
Usage of the proxy server is completely transparent for the
users and does not afiect system performance. Users have to
explicitly opt-in for the proxy and they are aware that their
activity is logged and we provide tools to selectively remove
logged data or opt-out.


For each accessed document we extract document metadata, 
along with other user interaction indicators (mouse
and keyboard activity and time spent on page), which are
used to calculate implicit feedback on the page.


The context model is a hypergraph 

%vzorce


Using this representation is advantageous, as
it allows for good denormalization and allows us to track
each of the vertices independently. It may seem intuitive
to merge accesses and pages, but this models allows us to
abstract page from access, and if the document represented
by the URL (page) changes, we can create new vertex in the
graph and connect it respectively.

We use following series of steps to produce an interest
model that can be used for recommendation or personalisation.

\begin{itemize}
\item First, search context can be selected by any arbitrary
method. Context selection is based on selection of actions, 
e.g., we can use a long-term context and select all
documents ever viewed by the user, or we can leverage
activity based search context and select only the documents 
that she viewed for the purposes of her current
information goal.


\item Next, we extract a subgraph Hc from the original hy-pergraph H, by selecting only vertices Ac 2 A, that match the context restriction established in previous step. The subgraph also contains vertices adjacent to Ac, i.e., Pc 2 P and Tc 2 C and their connecting edges 
Ec 2 E. 

\item The subgraph Hc now represents the interest model
for current context. We further enrich it by finding its
nearest neighbors in terms of similarity in access patterns 
and similarity of the acquired document metadata 
T. This interest model and models of similar
interests can now be used for personalisation or 
recommendation.

\end{itemize}

To validate this context acquisition approach we ran synthetic w
xperiments [10] and experiments in a live system [11].
In both cases we used a simple form of long-term context,
by using Hc = H. In both cases we evaluated our approach
in the domain of personalised search and used two simple
query reformulation approaches:


search the query history in the interest models 
(extracted from URLs of accesses to search engine, find
reformulation patterns of the current query and select 
the one with highest satisfaction score, calculated
by considering implicit feedback on clicked results, assuming, 
that unsatisfactory search results lead to clicks
with low implicit feedback scores and to a further query
reformulation until the user is satisfied.


search the metadata in the interest models and find
terms that are often co-occurring with the terms from
the current query. Select the most frequent co-occurrences 
and extend the original query.


Using this experimental setup, we were able to substantially 
increase the relevance of search results and thus validate 
our approach. The proposed framework has two important 
properties: both context, and the personalisation
method can be selected independently and we believe that
using a difierent form of context than the long-term context, 
one could improve the relevance of recommendations
even more.


\section{ACTIVITY-BASED CONTEXT}
Basic idea of an activity-based context is that information 
from previously accessed documents can help to understand 
the current information goal. E.g., imagine a series of
queries: watermelon; used cars; bentley; jaguar { it is easy
to see that the current query jaguar is connected with two
previous queries, used cars and bentley and that the search
goal in this case is to buy a car. With this knowledge, the
personalisation can be moved towards search results that
deal with used jaguar cars.


The problem of finding activity-based search context is
stated as follows. The user is issuing queries and clicking
on search results. The goal of activity-based search context
detection is, for a current query, select the previous queries
(and their respective clicked search results), that are part
of the same search goal as the current query. This problem
is equivalent to the problem of detecting the search session,
when we define the search session as a set of queries following
the same goal. Note that the queries that are part of the
same search session may not be issued sequentially, but can
be interleaved.


The problem of detecting search sessions is well researched,
although the definition of a search session usually varies.
The approaches could be categorized into three classes. The
methods that are based on time, e.g. [6], are not appropriate 
for this definition of search session. They assume that a
search session is bounded by a higher inactivity time, i.e. if
the query is issued after a specified time from the last query
elapsed, the query is considered to start a new session. The
pause in the interaction with search engine can be caused
by external factors (e.g., phone call, lunch) and user can return 
to the original task afterwards. Similarly, the search
goal can change rapidly, without a pause in the interaction.
The other class of approaches is based on lexical similarity
between queries [7]. Two queries are considered part of the
same session if they share common terms. However, this
class of approaches does not deal with semantic similarity,
e.g., queries information retrieval and IR. The third class of

%tabuľka
approaches uses signals from the search results page, such as snippets from the search results page [4].

The existing methods have two downsides: firstly, most
of them do not consider multitasking in search, and restrict
the search session to sequential queries. Once the search
session is terminated, in cannot be reopened to add new
queries. Secondly, existing methods that are using search
results consider all search results equal.


We designed a method that considers multitasking in web
search and incorporates implicit feedback on the search results. 
We build a query model, where we leverage the same
lightweight semantic document metadata as in our personalisation 
framework. Each query is associated with the respective clicked 
search results. We leverage a negative implicit
feedback and assume that a search result that was viewed
for less than a specified number of seconds was not relevant
to the search goal and therefore closed. We remove these
documents from the query model.


To put the query into a session, we look at the clicked
search results and their respective metadata. For each query,
a metadata vector is built and compared to metadata vectors
of currently active search session. When the vectors are similar 
(in terms of shared metadata), the query is considered
part of the session and its metadata is merged into session
model. At any given time, a stack of previous search sessions
is being maintained and if the query model does not match
the current session model, the stack of sessions is searched,
until a match is found or the stack is exhausted. When
a match is found, the matching search session is moved to
the top of the stack and becomes active search session. Old
search sessions are removed from the stack automatically, so
that they cannot become active.


We have compared the results with other approaches (tem-
poral with a window of 5 and 30 minutes and lexical). The
results are described in Table 1. Precision indicates the internal 
coherence of the session. First, queries from automatically 
detected session are linked to the manually detected
sessions and precision is calculated as the ratio of the cardinality 
of the best match to the cardinality of the whole
session. Recall indicates the completeness of the session. It
is calculated as the ratio of cardinality of the best match
against the manually created sessions to the cardinality of
the best-matched session. Best results were obtained by
combining the lexical approach with our session matching
method (referenced in the table as metadata) as a fallback,
i.e., the first heuristics of a session match is the lexical s
imilarity of queries and if it is negative, the document metadata
are compared.

The preliminary experiments seem promising and we believe 
that applying activity based context to a personalisation process 
will yield better results that using a long-term
context.


\section{RECURRENT TEMPORAL CONTEXT}
We postulate that there are patterns in user behavior
changes that are related to time. For example searching
for summer resorts before summer holidays, or searching for
which movies to watch on Sunday night. We believe that
these patterns are recurrent and appear more or less 
regularly during the same periods of day, week, month or year.


To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that
would support or disprove our hypotheses. There are many
works that study the temporal dynamics of search, but all of
them analyze it only globally, and do not focus on individual
patterns. For example, in [13] authors analyze transactional
logs from the Excite search engine using Markov matrices
and Poisson sampling and explore variations in aggregated
users' searches related to changes of time in day. Or similarly, 
Beitzel et al. ~\cite{beitzel} analyzed a partially manually topically 
labeled large-scale transactional log of a search engine
and analyzed topical patterns in the queries and results, but
again, only in an aggregated form.


In our work, we analyze changes in user interest for the
top-100 users from the publicly available AOL search engine.
We focused on analyzing the patterns of interest changes
during work hours and free time. For each user in the top100 
log, we have separated the clicked search results into two
distinct clusters using two setups: work-week vs. weekend
and work-hours (9:00 - 17:00) vs. free-time (the rest). Next,
we compared how well were the two clusters separated from
each other in each of the two setups.


For this analysis, we used HTML code of the search results 
and extracted keywords, description and title of each
page (provided by the author) and it's respective ODP 
categories. For each user, these vectors of textual metadata
were converted to binary vectors, 1 indicating presence of
the metadata in the vector, 0 otherwise. These vectors were
then treated as vectors in Euclidian space and we calculated 
standard Davies-Bouldin score for each user's clusters
in both setups. Davies-Bouldin score represents how well
are the clusters separated from each other and how coherent
are they internally. The results for both setups are displayed
in Figure 1.

The Davies-Bouldin scores suggest, that our hypotheses
are not valid in general, but there exist some users, for which
they are true. In both setups, there are some users for whom
the score is low, which means that they indeed search for 
semantically difierent information during weekend and during
work-week or during work-time and free-time hours. What
is interesting, is that the calculated scores cover the whole
range of scores nearly linearly, without any peaks. This 
suggests that the probability of a user changing interests on the
two temporal conditions exhibits uniform distribution.


\section{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK}
In our work, we try to design a framework for personalisation 
based on context constraints, with the aim of selecting
the proper type of context dynamically. So far, we have
designed and evaluated a framework based on lightweight
semantics and nearest neighbors. We have identified two
types of context that might be helpful in constraining the

 %graf
personalisation process and have done some initial work in
order to understand them better. We have designed and
evaluated a novel approach for search session detection that
is based on implicit feedback and designed with multitasking
in mind. We have also done an initial analysis of temporal
recurrent patterns in user searching behavior and are now
working on extending our work to automatically detect 
different types of recurrent patterns in clickthrough data 
automatically. Eventually, we plan to design a method for
selecting an appropriate type of context (e.g., long-term,
activity-based, or temporal) based on the analysis of the
contexts found by each of the methods.


Our approach is not limited to search personalisation only,
it can be used for any kind of personalisation or recommendation. 
We believe that the two identified context types can
be found in other domains, e.g. a user researching a certain %\cite
topic in a news portal is apt for an activity-based context
recommendation %\cite, or a user searching for information on
Olympic games is apt for a temporal context based recom-
mendation.
